            <p id="p3">Set against the shimmering azure of the glittering Aegean Sea, the Santorini Blue Domes feature
                in almost
                every single postcard from the quintessential Cycladic island. The most photographed Santorini blue
                domes churches are located in Oia and are the churches of Agios Spiridonas (Saint Spyridon) and
                Anasteseos (the Church of the Resurrection). Both are built at the edge of the cliffs right next to one
                another.
                While still wandering the streets of Oia, you may also want to visit another Santorini blue domes
                church, Panagia Platsani, which is dedicated to the Akathist Hymn of the Virgin Mary. Originally, it was
                built inside the castle of Oia, but a destructive earthquake in 1956 made the soil extremely unstable
                and ruined the church. It was rebuilt, though, at the center of Oia, where it stands to date.</p></center>

            <p id="p3">Italy has a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The summer months
                (June to August) are generally the most popular time to visit, but they can also be the hottest and
                busiest, with temperatures often reaching over 90°F (32°C). If you prefer cooler weather, spring (April
                to May) and fall (September to October) are good times to visit, with mild temperatures and fewer
                crowds. Winter (November to March) can be cold and wet, with some snow in the northern and central
                regions, but it can also be a good time to visit if you're interested in skiing in the Italian Alps.</p>

                The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km)
                strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. city of San
                Francisco, California—the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula—to Marin County, carrying both
                U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. It also carries pedestrian and bicycle
                traffic, and is designated as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 95. Recognized by the American Society of Civil
                Engineers as one of the Wonders of the Modern World,[7] the bridge is one of the most internationally
                recognized symbols of San Francisco and California.

                Navagio was once named Agios Georgios, getting its new name from a shipwreck that was washed ashore in
                1980! The ship MV Panagiotis said to have been smuggling large amounts of contraband cigarettes, was
                abandoned by its crew due to poor weather conditions and trouble with the local navy authorities!
                Nowadays, the rusted ship is well-covered in Navagio’s characteristic white sand, whereas many travelers
                have left their mark on the ship through the use of graffiti.
                Shipwreck Navagio is a completely non-organized seashore, having an absence of on-the-beach facilities
                other than the grand shipwreck! It can only be approached by boat (usually from the ports of Porto Vromi
                and Agios Nikolaos) or via a privately rented speedboat. The viewpoint above the beach can be easily
                reached by car, though!
                Keep in mind that due to its popularity, this shore gets overcrowded during the high season!

                Ao Nang beach is a part of the pristine Krabi Islands present in Thailand, which is also the main beach
                of the Ao Nang province. Located in the heart of Ao Nang, it is easily accessible, making it one of the
                most popular beaches in Thailand.Despite being a beach town, you'll have to go a little ways to find a
                proper place to swim in Ao Nang. The main beach is also the main departure point for long tail boats
                heading to the islands, and as such it is quite a hazard to swim there.Ao Nang (Thai: อ่าวนาง,
                pronounced [ʔàːw nāːŋ]) is a resort town and one of the ten subdistricts (tambon) of Mueang Krabi
                District, Krabi, Thailand.
